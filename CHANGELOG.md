# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-24

Prepared for publication; this version has not been published.

- `read_array` reads raw numeric files, `.npy` files, and in-memory NumPy
  arrays, with `infer`, labels, `field_axis=`, `variables_from=`, byte
  order, storage order, header offsets, and memory-mapping.
- `read_binary` reads packed or explicitly padded mixed records into
  separate typed variables. `fixed_text` declares strict UTF-8/ASCII text
  decoding and padding; numeric fields retain their widths and kinds.
- `tidy()` wraps xarray objects; `TidyArray` reports its axes, labels, axis
  roles, and anything the reader inferred.
- Tidy-layer verbs: `select` with tidy3's selection helpers, `filter`,
  `slice`/`slice_head`/`slice_tail`, `mutate` with write-back and vector
  assignment, `group_by` by axis, value, or `bins()`, `summarise`,
  `ungroup`, `pull`, `bind_cols`, and `left_join`/`inner_join`/`full_join`.
- Expressions: `col`, `variable`, `label`, `env`, `fields`, `[x, y, z]`
  vectors, `if_else`, and reductions `mean`, `sum`, `min`, `max`, `median`,
  `std`, `var` (variance, as in tidy3 and dplyr), `any`, and `all` with
  `over=` and `na_rm=`, plus `n()` for observation counts.
- Exact label alignment, with reordering by label and explicit joins.
- Metadata: wrapping keeps attributes and encodings; new and computed
  results clear stale serialization encoding and inherited attributes,
  direct aliases keep theirs, and joins report dropped conflicting
  attributes.
- Lazy input: NetCDF and Dask-backed data stay lazy through inspection,
  selection, regular positional slicing, arithmetic, and reductions until
  `collect()`; grouping, filtering, and field write-back read the values
  they need, as documented.
- Array layer: `dot` with `over=`, elementwise numeric functions, `conj`,
  `real`, `imag`, `angle`, `arctan2`, `rename_axes`, and `pack`.
- `formula()`: plain mathematical text and a strict LaTeX dialect with
  plot3's conventions, subscripts as axis indices, labels, and positions,
  `\sum` with optional checked bounds, `bind=` for index letters and
  values, and show-back of how each formula was read.
- Notebook layer (`%load_ext tidy3a.jupyter`): bare names in tidy3A verbs,
  settled when the verb runs, with an error when a name is both data and a
  notebook variable; `[x, y, z] = …` inside `mutate`; only tidy3A's own
  calls are rewritten, so tidy3 and tidy3A share a notebook.
- `n()` counts observations on the axes every non-scalar variable shares.
- Inspection output shows time labels to the second (or as dates) and
  floats to 10 significant digits, with a gap before each axis role.
- Examples on real data: a nuScenes Mini LiDAR sweep, and three public
  sample datasets (air temperature, ERA-Interim wind, a Landsat scene),
  each checked against plain NumPy or xarray.
- Source distributions include documentation, examples, and prototype
  tests. Packaging checks build a wheel from the source archive and
  validate both distributions' metadata. The build requires setuptools
  77.0.3 or newer for the license metadata.
- Requires Python 3.11+, NumPy 2.0+, pandas 2.2.2+ (now declared, as
  tidy3A imports it directly), and xarray 2024.6+.
- Publishing a GitHub Release runs the version check and reusable CI gate,
  then uploads the validated distributions to PyPI through trusted publishing.
